## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You need to be able to work in a Jupyter Notebook on your computer. The following packages (libraries) need to be installed. You can install these packages via conda or pip.

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- csv

## Project Overview: investigate-soccer-dataset <a name="project_overview"></a>

Investigate the European Soccer Database

This was done as a project, part of the Data Analyst Nanodegree by Udacity.

## Project Details <a name="details"></a>

The Project was divided into Three Parts i.e. :

### Part I - Get Organized <a name="p"></a>

creating a single folder that will eventually contain:

- The report communicating your findings
- Any Python code you wrote as part of your analysis
- The data set you used (which you will not need to submit)

### Part II - Analyze The Data <a name="abt"></a>

> Brainstorm some questions you could answer using the data set you chose, then start answering those questions.

> Try and suggest questions that promote looking at relationships between multiple variables. You should aim to analyze at least one dependent variable and three independent variables in your investigation. Make sure you use NumPy and pandas where they are appropriate!

### Part III - Share Findings <a name="r"></a>

> Once you have finished analyzing the data, create a report that shares the findings you found most interesting. If you use a Jupyter notebook, share your findings alongside the code you used to perform the analysis. Make sure that your report text is contained in Markdown cells to clearly distinguish your comments and findings from your code work. You should also feel free to use other tools and software to craft your final report, but make sure that you can submit your report as an HTML or PDF file so that it can be opened easily.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project.I was interested in investigate-soccer-dataset to better understand: </br>

## Questions Posed and answered in the analysis <a name="Q"></a>

- Q1:- Which players had the most penalties ?
- Q2:- what The most preferred foot ?
- Q3:- what is the relation between number of goals scored when teams are playing in their home ground?
- Q4:- Which league has most number of goals scored?
- Q5:- what is the biggest matches that were played in season ?
